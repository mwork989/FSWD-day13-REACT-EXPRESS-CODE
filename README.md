A URL is a reference (an address) to a resource on the Internet. It specifies the location of a web resource (like a web page) and the mechanism for retrieving it, typically via HTTP or HTTPS. 

"HTTP" stands for "Hypertext Transfer Protocol." It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. 

HTTP defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands.

 For example, when you enter a URL in your web browser, this actually sends an HTTP command to the web server directing it to fetch and transmit the requested web page.


HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) methods, also known as HTTP verbs, define the action to be performed on a given resource


GET: Requests data from a specified resource. It's used to retrieve information from the server. GET requests should only retrieve data and should not have any other effect on the data.


POST: Sends data to a server to create/update a resource. It's often used when submitting form data or uploading a file.

PUT: Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content. It's used to update a resource completely.

DELETE: Removes the specified resource. This method is used to delete a resource identified by a URL.
